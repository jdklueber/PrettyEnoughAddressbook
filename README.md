# Pretty Enough Address Book

This application was developed in order to demonstrate how a developer 
with little to no graphic design training can make a prototype 
application that at least looks presentable.

## Scripts
* Run npm install first to grab all the dependencies
* npm start to spin up the development server
* git checkout unstyled to look at the raw version of the application
* git checkout styled to look at the finished product
* Rerun npm install whenever you switch branches as they have different requirements!

## Documentation
The docs directory contatins an MS word doc detailing all the changes made to style the raw application, along with a Balsamiq Wireframes project showing the design, and png files exported from the wireframes for ease of viewing.

## Key Branches
* unstyled - The application in its rawest state
* styled - The application in its fully styled state
